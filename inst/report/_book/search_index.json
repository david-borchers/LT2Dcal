[["introduction.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction", " Chapter 1 Introduction Accurate estimation of animal abundance is a fundamental aspect of ecological research and wildlife conservation. Since total enumeration are rarely possible for natural populations of animals, robust estimation methods have to be used. Commonly used approaches for estimating animal abundance include mark-recapture, distance sampling, and mark-recapture distance sampling (MRDS). Each of these methods relies on different principles and assumptions to estimate population sizes. The mark-recapture method is based on capturing and marking individuals, followed by subsequent recapture efforts to estimate the total population size. Distance sampling, on the other hand, involves estimating the detection probability of individuals at different distances from the observer, allowing for the extrapolation of population size based on detection functions. MRDS is an extension that accounts for both the detection probabilities of individuals at different distances and the potential for recapture of marked individuals, providing more precise estimates, even when assumptions of closed populations and uniform detection probabilities are not fully met. However, the accuracy and reliability of these estimation methods depend heavily on how well their underlying assumptions are met. Assumptions such as closed population, random sampling, and homogeneous detection probabilities play a crucial role in determining the performance of the models. When these assumptions are violated, the estimates obtained from the methods can be biased and lead to misleading conclusions. 2D Distance sampling is a new method that has the potential to work when these other methods fail. It uses a similar principle to distance sampling but the observers collect the forward distance as well as the perpendicular distance to the animal. This additional data allows the model to be flexible when dealing with different animal distributions and detection functions. In this study, we systematically tested the four methods using a range of scenarios with varying degrees of assumption compliance and violations. By simulating populations with known abundance and detectability patterns, we aimed to assess how each method performed under different conditions. We have based our populations on snow leopard prey data from Gobi Gurvansaikhan National Park. In the following sections of this report, we will present the methodology of our simulation study and the results obtained from the simulations. We will then use 2D distance sampling to analyse the snow leopard prey data.

This method is based on the concept of sampling, marking, and then recapturing individuals from the target population. By utilizing this approach, researchers can extrapolate the population size and gain valuable insights into population dynamics, species abundance, and conservation efforts. The fundamental principle behind mark-recapture lies in the idea that the probability of capturing an individual within the population is the same for each capture event. Once an individual is captured, it is marked in some way, making it distinguishable from other members of the population. The marked individuals are then released back into the wild, allowing them to mix freely with the unmarked individuals. Subsequently, during the recapture phase, researchers perform another sampling effort, capturing a new group of individuals from the population. The proportion of marked individuals in the recaptured sample allows scientists to estimate the total population size based on the assumption of a closed population. 2.1.1 Closed populations The Lincoln-Peterson MR estimator is one of the most classic and widely used methods for estimating the population size of closed populations. Proposed independently by Peterson in the 1890s and by Lincoln in the 1920s, this estimator relies on two sampling events: the initial capture, where a subset of the population is marked, and the subsequent recapture, where the marked individuals are identified among the newly captured individuals. The Chapman mark-recapture estimator is a modified version of the traditional Lincoln-Peterson estimator with less bias and is less affected by zeros. Chapman MR estimator (1951) \\[\\hat{N}_{CPM} = \\frac{(n_{1} + 1)(n_{2} + 1)}{m_{2}+1}-1\\] where: \\(\\hat{N}_{CPM}\\) is the estimated population size. \\(n_{1}\\) is the number of individuals captured and marked in the first occasion. \\(n_{2}\\) is the number of marked individuals recaptured in the second occasion. \\(m_{2}\\) is the number of recaptured individuals that were already marked in the first occasion. The accuracy of this estimate relies on a number of assumptions being met. Assumption 1. The population is closed to additions and deletions; In other words, no individuals are added to or removed from the population through birth, death, immigration, or emigration during the study period. An exception is when there are equal proportions of additions or deletions for marked and unmarked individuals during the sampling period. In cases where significant movements occur, potential bias might need to be introduced to the results or more advanced models might be needed to account for population dynamics. Assumption 2. All animals are equally likely to be captured in each sample; Sometimes after initial capture, animals may learn to avoid the traps or area where the capture occurred, causing them to be captured less frequently (“trap shy”). The opposite (“trap happy”) may also occur, making them more likely to be captured. Individuals may also inherently different capture probabilities, and if ignored, the resulting abundance estimates are likely to be negatively biased. Assumption 3. Marks are not lost and not overlooked by the observer It is possible that marks may fade, fall off, or be lost over time, making individuals indistinguishable from unmarked ones during recapture events. Ensuring durable and effective marking techniques is essential to maintain the integrity of the mark-recapture process and achieve unbiased estimates. 2.2 Distance Sampling Distance sampling is another widely used method in ecological research or estimating animal abundance and density. Here we focus on conventional distance sampling, the fundamental distance sampling techniques among all. 2.2.1 Line transect sampling Usually, observers travel along the transect lines that are strategically placed across the study area to ensure coverage of different habitats and representative sampling of the population. Upon detecting an object, they record the perpendicular distance from the line to the identified object. In some cases, additional information, such as the angle of detection or group size are also recorded for the purpose of multiple-covariate distance sampling (MCDS) analysis. Detection function \\(g(x)\\)describes the probability of detecting an animal at different distances from the transect lines. A fundamental assumption is that all objects present on the line are detected, i.e. \\(g(0)=1\\) ; however it is expected that objects become progressively more challenging to detect as their distance from the line increases, leading to a decrease in detection with increasing distance. Commonly used detection functions include uniform, half-normal and hazard rate. Example of adjustment terms include cosine, Hermite polynomial series and simple polynomial series. Once the detection function is fitted, the estimator can calculate animal density and thus abundance by accounting for the area surveyed and the proportion of animals detected at different distances. The obtained abundance estimates can be extrapolated to the entire study area if the survey design is representative of the entire habitat. Animal density \\(D\\) is estimated by: \\[\\hat{D} = \\frac{n}{2wL\\hat{P}_a}\\] \\[\\hat{P}_a = \\frac{\\int_{0}^{w}\\hat{g}(x)dx}{w}\\] where: \\(n\\) is the number of animals detected. \\(w\\) is the half-width of the strip. \\(L\\) is the lengths of transect lines. \\(\\hat{P}_a\\) is the probability that a randomly chosen animal within the surveyed area is detected. \\(\\hat{g}(x)\\) is the estimate of detection function. 2.3 Further Reading Borchers, D.L., Buckland, S.T. and Zucchini, W.

In this study, we aimed to assess how each method performs using a range of scenarios with varying degrees of assumption compliance and violations. In each scenario, artificial datasets are created with with known population sizes, density patterns, detectability patterns, etc. to test the accuracy and precision of estimators. source(&quot;report.simulation.R&quot;) library(knitr) 3.1 Simulation scenarios 3.1.1 Initial perpendicular distance distribution Perpendicular distance refers to the minimum distance to the transect line at which animals are detected. 3 different levels are considered: uniformly distributed, avoiding the line and attracted to the line. par(mfrow=c(1,3)) xs &lt;- seq(0,1,length=100) # uniformly distributed plot(xs, pi.const(x=xs,logphi=NA,w=1), type=&#39;l&#39;,xlab=&#39;Perp. distance, x&#39;,ylab=expression(pi(x))) # avoiding the line plot(xs, pi.chnorm(x=xs,logphi=c(0, -0.5),w=1), type=&#39;l&#39;,xlab=&#39;Perp. distance, x&#39;,ylab=expression(pi(x))) # attracted to the line plot(xs,pi.norm(x=xs,logphi=c(0, 1),w=1), type=&#39;l&#39;,xlab=&#39;Perp. distance, x&#39;,ylab=expression(pi(x))) Figure 3.1: Potential Animal Distributions 3.1.2 Movement after first detection For the mark recapture methods there are two detection occasions, which could be , for example, two observers on different decks of a boat or , as in the snow leopard prey data, two observers walking the transect at different times. Animal movement is not an issue for the first scenario as the animals move slowly in comparison to the boat, so will not move far enough to have different detection probabilities between the two observers. However, in our snow leopard prey example, there is 30 minutes between the first and second observer walking the transect so the animals could move significantly between the two observers. We consider two types of movement after the first detection: random movement and avoidant movement away from the transect. We based our simulation on Ibex movement data in Johansson et al. (2022), which shows that the distance moved follows roughly a log normal distribution with mean log(12) + 1.5 and standard deviation 1.5, df2 &lt;- sim.dat(50,2) fig2 &lt;- df2 %&gt;% plot_ly( x = ~x, y = ~y, size = ~size, color = ~level, frame = ~obs, type = &#39;scatter&#39;, mode = &#39;markers&#39;) fig2 3.1.3 Imperfect Matching Mark recapture methods also assume that the observers can perfectly identify which animals were seen by both observers and which animals were seen by just one observer. This becomes problematic for animals without unique identifying markings in surveys where they could move between detection occasions. We simulated imperfect matching by setting any animals detected on the second occasion within 300m of an animal detected on the first animal were recorded as the same animal, taking the closest as the match if there were multiple within this range. Any animals further than 1000m were recorded as different, and the probability of matching animals within the range was generated using a inverse power function with parameters \\(\\beta_1\\) = 6, \\(\\beta_2\\) = 0.000005. (Thanks to the snow leopard prey team for suggesting these limits) 3.2 Simulation Results For each of the 12 scenarios we calculated the bias and coverage probability of the 4 methods. Due to time constraints we only fitted a hazard-rate detection function with no adjustments for conventional distance sampling and only used the independent observer configuration with a hazard rate distance model for MRDS. This means the models for these methods may not be the best fit, and it could be possible to achieve a smaller bias or larger coverage probability. With more time we would fit multiple models to each set of simulated data and choose the best using AIC. We also only fit one 2D model, but as it was the model used the generate the data it should be the best model regardless. 3.2.1 Uniform Animal Distribution With uniform animal distribution we expect conventional distance and 2D distance sampling to perform similarly, as all the assumptions for both methods are met. Our results show that they both have similar coverage probabilities, and whilst conventional distance may appear to be more biased, this is more likely a result of only fitting one model rather than performing model selection. As these methods involve walking the transect just once, they are not affected by movement between observers. # Scenario 2 # Initial density: uniform + Movement: avoidance + Matching: imperfect #sc2 &lt;- simulation(n=600, b=99, 0, 0, TRUE) load(&quot;sc2.RData&quot;) sc2.table &lt;- kable(sc2.out &lt;- result(sc2, n=600), col.names = c(&quot;Bias&quot;, &quot;Coverage Probability&quot;), caption = &quot;Avoidance Movement&quot;) (#tab:Sc.3)Random Movement Bias Coverage Probability MR -0.5712948 0.0000000 DS -0.2426987 0.8686869 MRDS -0.2327096 0.5050505 2D -0.0241737 0.8315789 (#tab:Sc.1)Avoidance Movement Bias Coverage Probability MR -0.5371078 0.0000000 DS -0.1746048 0.9090909 MRDS -0.1492886 0.7979798 2D 0.0442049 0.8541667 Mark recapture performs poorly in this scenario and all the other scenarios as detectability declines with distance. This means there is unmodelled heterogeneity in the population, so it is negatively biased. MRDS is negatively biased with random animal movement as this violates the assumption that each animal has the same detection probability for each observer. It is less negatively biased with avoidance as second observer will see less animals than the first due to them now being further away. This results in a lower estimated detection probability and therefore a higher estimate.

This is due to some individuals that were seen twice being mistakenly identified as two separate animals, leading to a lower estimate of detection probability and hence a higher estimate of abundance. Whilst it looks like MRDS should be the best estimator in the scenario with avoidance movement and imperfect matching, this is actually because effects of breaking multiple assumptions happen to balance out in this specific situation. This results in very variable estimates, as the variance of the \\(N\\hat\\)s was {r var(sc2[[3]]$N.hat[sc2[[3]]$N.hat &lt; 3*600])/99} for MRDS, compared to {r var(sc2[[4]]$N.hat[sc2[[4]]$N.hat &lt; 3*600])/99} for 2D Distance. 3.2.2 Avoiding Transect As expected, only 2D Distance is unbiased when the animals initially avoid the transect.

However, as these detections are a result of more animals being far from the transect rather than a high detection probability, the models overestimate the detection probability and so underestimate the abundance.

"],["real-data.html", "Chapter 4 Real Data 4.1 Mark Recapture 4.2 Summary", " Chapter 4 Real Data We will now use these methods to analyse the real snow leopard prey data. The observers surveyed 60 transects in 10 blocks twice, with 30 minutes between the first and second observer starting the survey. The observers had limited rangefinders so only the first observer recorded the radial distance to the group, the bearing of the path and the bearing of the group they saw. This means we cannot use mrds to analyse this data as there are no distances for the second observer. There were 2 species included in the survey: ibex and argali. They saw 242 groups in total, and 193 of them have distance data. 4.1 Mark Recapture We start by using the Chapman estimator to estimate the total number of groups. This gives us an estimate of 425 with a 95% confidence interval of 348.4897014, 517.95112. Separating the data by species we estimate there are 308 (241.2495366, 392.1258668) ibex groups and 115 (84.2854575, 156.1285628) argali groups. From our previous simulations we expect this to be negatively biased, as there is unmodelled heterogeneity in the population from detectability decreasing with distance. The estimates for the individual species are probably more reliable as it accounts for any difference in detectability between the two species. ## Conventional Distance Sampling We now turn to CDS. Upon closer inspection, many detection distances (both perpendicular and forward) appeared to be rounded to zero, likely as a result of the bearings being rounded to the nearest 5 degrees. To prevent this from impacting the model fit we simply added a small random number to each zero observation. We only use the jittered perpendicular distances for conventional distance sampling, but we will use the jittered forward distances in the 2D section. hist(CDSData$distance, main = &quot;Perpendicular Distance&quot;, xlab = &quot;Distance&quot;) Figure 4.1: Histograms of perpendicular distances We decided to truncate the data at 1600m, which excluded one outlier at 1820m. We then fitted a series of models using both half normal and hazard rate detection functions to the combined data set and to each species individually. We included size, block and observer (and species in the combined model) as covariates, and chose the best model using AIC. (Full analysis can be found in the _CDS analysis file.) The best fitting model according to AIC involved fitting separate hazard rate functions with block as a covariate to the ibex and argali data sets. However, the argali detection function has a large spike at zero, which is not realistic. (#fig:plot-separate species)Detection function and QQ-plots for ibex and argali models Therefore, we choose the combined model as our best model, as the AIC was only slightly higher (2575.8122521 vs 2573.1957975) and it doesn’t have the spike at zero. Figure 4.2: Detection function and QQ-plots for combined model This gives an estimate of 733 total groups with a 95% confidence interval of 575.5283198, 889.8593569. This is much higher than the MCR estimate, but may be biased if the animal distribution is not uniform. ## 2D Distance Sampling We will now use 2D distance sampling to investigate if the animals are uniformly distributed. 61 of the detected groups were behind the observers so did not have a valid “forward” distance. This leaves 132 usable observations. { forward-hist, echo = F} hist(DistData$forward, main = \"Forward Distance\", xlab = \"Distance (m)\") Our best fitting model used the 2-parameter inverse power hazard detection function and a half normal distribution for the animal density. All of the best fitting models used a half normal animal distribution, which implies that the animals are attracted to the line rather than avoiding it as initially thought. This could be due to the non random line placement, as the observers travel along valleys or ridges that are easier to walk along so the animals could also favour the easier terrain. Figure 4.3: Detection and distribution functions for best model (h1 and normal) We tried fitting different models to each species in the survey, but this had a higher AIC than the combined model (3515.1502831 vs 3512.560206 for combined model). Interestingly, the argali appear to be uniformly distributed across the area whereas the ibex exhibit line attraction. However, there are only 39 argali groups with valid distances so further investigation is needed before drawing any conclusions. With more time we would fit a model that had species as a covariate. The best combined model estimates there are 402 groups in total.

This would make the conventional distance estimate positively biased, and so it is reasonable that the 2D estimate would be lower. We would expect the mark recapture estimate to be negatively biased due to the declining detectability with distance, but it is higher. This is likely due to imperfect matching in the data, so we recommend 2D Distance sampling as the most reliable estimate, as it is not impacted by imperfect matching or non uniform animal distribution.
