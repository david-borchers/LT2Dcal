You can use anything that Pandoc’s Markdown supports; for example, a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). 1.1 Usage Each bookdown chapter is an .Rmd file, and each .Rmd file can contain one (and only one) chapter. A chapter must start with a first-level heading: # A good chapter, and can contain one (and only one) first-level heading. Use second-level and higher headings within chapters like: ## A short section or ### An even shorter section. The index.Rmd file is required, and is also your first book chapter. It will be the homepage when you render the book. 1.2 Render book You can render the HTML version of this example book without changing anything: Find the Build pane in the RStudio IDE, and Click on Build Book, then select your output format, or select “All formats” if you’d like to use multiple formats from the same book source files. Or build the book from the R console: bookdown::render_book() To render this example to PDF as a bookdown::pdf_book, you’ll need to install XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.org/tinytex/. 1.3 Preview book As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in “Preview book,” or from the R console: bookdown::serve_book() "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).

[["d-distance-sampling.html", "Chapter 6 2D Distance Sampling 6.1 Introduction", " Chapter 6 2D Distance Sampling 6.1 Introduction 2D Distance Sampling builds on standard distance sampling by including the forward distance to the detected animal as well as the perpendicular distance. This removes the assumptions that the animals are uniformly distributed and that p(0) = 1, so this method is useful for situations where the other methods covered previously are not suitable. ##Simulation - Non Uniform Distribution We start by simulating attraction to the line by generating 200 animals using a half normal distribution with parameters 678.7507661, 116.1516889. We used a hazard rate detection function with parameters 4.945767, 0.714222. The parameters chosen are the best model for our real data. We then fitted a model using a half normal distribution for animal density and hazard detection function. We did not fit any other models for efficiency purposes. This gives a bias of 6.409596 , so we can confirm it is unbiased. ## Simulation - Comparison to Mark Recapture Double Observer mark recapture methods are the current standard for estimating abundance of snow leopard prey. Our previous simulations have shown these have serious flaws, so we used both a 2D distance model and the Chapman estimator to estimate the abundance from the same data (simulated using the same parameters as above). Figure 6.1: Histograms of abundance estimates using 2D distance sampling and the Chapman estimator The Chapman estimator was significantly negatively biased due to the unmodelled heterogeneity in the population. Adding random animal movement and imperfect matching gives a similar problem. Figure 6.2: Histograms of abundance estimates using the Chapman estimator with random movment From this it is clear that double-observer mark-recapture will yield significantly biased estimates of abundance of snow leopard prey, even if the animals do not move and the observers can perfectly match the individuals seen. We recommend instead using 2D distance sampling, as it accounts for the non uniform animal distribution as well as the declining detectability with distance. It is also requires less time to be spent surveying, as each transect only need to be walked once. ##Further Reading Borchers, D.L. and Cox, M.J. (2016).
