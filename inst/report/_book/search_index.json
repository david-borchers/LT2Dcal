[["distance-sampling.html", "Chapter 3 Distance sampling 3.1 Line transect sampling 3.2 Further Reading", " Chapter 3 Distance sampling Distance sampling is another widely used method in ecological research or estimating animal abundance and density. Here we focus on conventional distance sampling, the fundamental distance sampling techniques among all. 3.1 Line transect sampling Usually, observers travel along the transect lines that are strategically placed across the study area to ensure coverage of different habitats and representative sampling of the population. Upon detecting an object, they record the perpendicular distance from the line to the identified object. In some cases, additional information, such as the angle of detection or group size are also recorded for the purpose of multiple-covariate distance sampling (MCDS) analysis. Detection function \\(g(x)\\)describes the probability of detecting an animal at different distances from the transect lines. A fundamental assumption is that all objects present on the line are detected, i.e.Â \\(g(0)=1\\) ; however it is expected that objects become progressively more challenging to detect as their distance from the line increases, leading to a decrease in detection with increasing distance. Commonly used detection functions include uniform, half-normal and hazard rate. Example of adjustment terms include cosine, Hermite polynomial series and simple polynomial series. Once the detection function is fitted, the estimator can calculate animal density and thus abundance by accounting for the area surveyed and the proportion of animals detected at different distances. The obtained abundance estimates can be extrapolated to the entire study area if the survey design is representative of the entire habitat. Animal density \\(D\\) is estimated by: \\[\\hat{D} = \\frac{n}{2wL\\hat{P}_a}\\] \\[\\hat{P}_a = \\frac{\\int_{0}^{w}\\hat{g}(x)dx}{w}\\] where: \\(n\\) is the number of animals detected. \\(w\\) is the half-width of the strip. \\(L\\) is the lengths of transect lines. \\(\\hat{P}_a\\) is the probability that a randomly chosen animal within the surveyed area is detected. \\(\\hat{g}(x)\\) is the estimate of detection function. 3.2 Further Reading Buckland, S.T., Rexstad, E.A., Marques, T.A. and Oedekoven, C.S.
